# SnapBoltUI
SnapBolt is a new way to write webpages
and desktop apps alike, using near identical code.

SnapBolt is made to be simple and ideal for beginners 
yet a powerful and versatile tool.
SnapBolt code is shorter and more readable
than html or css. SnapBolt is also compatible with
other languages like css or javascript.
